                My name's Daniel Flanagan, I'm 25 years old and I'm originally 
                from a little Yorkshire village callled Barnby Dun in Doncaster.
                Barnby Dun stands apart from the post-industrial hell-scape that surrounds 
                it in the rest of Doncaster. It's an idilic little community which
                historically had a very wokring class character. In recent years that
                seems character seems to have given way to something a little less
                charming, but it was definitely a nice place to grow up.

                Since about 2016 I've lived in London. I moved here to study for a degree
                in History at Queen Mary, University of London. I graduated in 2019 and from
                there went to study for a Masters in History at University College London in
                Intellectual History and the History of Political Thought. I had an amazing
                time at university. Obviously, I enjoyed the social side of things, (sometimes
                a little too much) but I also surprised myself with just how much I got into 
                my studies. I've always been a bit of a nerd, but I never thought I'd be the
                kind of person who would spend hours in the library reading books about 
                17th century political philosophy. I guess I was wrong!
